			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi There! I work as a data scientist in the System Analysis Group for WSP Global Inc. at their Chicago office. How cities work? If one can reduce traffic congestion? How can we make cities more sustainable?  
			These are few of the questions I try to answer as a part of my professional day-to-day work. To do what I do, I moved to USA in 2014 for masters in transportation engineering from The University of
			Texas at Austin. Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree from The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.</p>
			
			<p>My interests lies in the exploring the nuances of societal networks such as people movement, traffic system, housing availability, energy usages etc. among several others. I like to think about some of the pressing 
			problems and attempt to don the entrepreneurial hat. I have been fortunate to present my ideas on affordable health-care for slum dwellers at Sao Paulo, equitable commuting scenario in Taipei and mass electric vehicle 
			adaptability for NITI Aayog, India. I believe that availability of plethora of data, increasing computing prowess and spur in machine learning-artificial intelligence (AI-ML) driven endeavors could check so many 
			societal inefficiencies, especially in the developing world.</p>
			
			<p>I have also tried to see many parts of the world (Asia, Europe, S.America and N.America) and lived in cities like Chicago, Austin, Miami. Though cities interest me, some of my best travel stories are from far away
			lands like Alaska & Utah. Occasionally, I like to show my amateur photography skill at @Instagram. You can also indulge me in giving my two cents on politics, policies and diplomacies time-to-time.</p>
