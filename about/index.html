			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi There! I work as a data scientist in the System Analysis Group for WSP Global Inc. at their Chicago office. How cities work? How could we reduce traffic congestion? 
			How can we make cities more sustainable? These are few of the questions I try to answer as a part of my professional day-to-day work. To do what I do, I moved to USA in 2014
			to obtained my masters in transportation engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree from The Indian Institute of 
			Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.</p>
			<p>You can optionally insert a brief bio here. You went to this school, you studied that, you now work in this field with research interests in that subject. At your previous 
			position at this place, you worked on this or that. You can list.</p>
