#Doing urbanization right:

Every minute there are 30 people migrating to Indian cities which account for an expected 500 million people making their way to Indian cities in a decade. With 70% of India's built environment for 2030 yet to take shape, there is a golden opportunity for Indian stakeholders to solve for basic amenities such as adequate & affordable houses to live, smooth transportation networks for daily commute, avaibility of good jobs, great education & medical infrastructure among others. Contrary to ideal scenario, there are increasing evidences that Indian cities are chocking up in providing basic delivery of public goods. The growing income and aspiration of people is leading to higher automobile purchase - thus clogging our cities [(18 kmph commute speed)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bengaluru-has-second-slowest-commute-speed-study/articleshow/70912200.cms?from=mdr), almost [annual flooding](https://twitter.com/fayedsouza/status/1179856647981678593) in the major cities, skewed job [growth]([http://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/jobspeak-report-april-2017.pdf](http://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/jobspeak-report-april-2017.pdf)) thus creating unbalanced demand for water, sanitation, drainage, housing units, as major problems.

Fortunately, India has around 52 cities with more than 1 million population spread across the nation which could be nodes of development countrywide, not just 7-8 metropolitian segments.

It is a generational opportunity to **do urbanization right** and take lead among the big economies. As urban centers are lifeline of the economy, the compounding effects of right urbanizations are immense. The focus on having at least 100 cities with $50 billion or more of GDP, spread around the country will lead on to forming massive cluster-wise growth, alluding to forming mega-regions (akin to the US or China) specializing in a particular market or more. China currently has 112 cities with 30 billion or more of GDP and they are seeing a good, balanced and connected growth (national high speed transport, communication, electric grid network). 

In order to achieve above, I think, below present some of the most importatnt areas which should be acted upon by stakeholders (state& central government, policymakers, matured companies, start-ups, local governing bodies, civil societies). Moreover, integrating artificially intelligence (AI) into public service delivery will go long way into increasing efficiency and scaling of the solutions.

1. **Transport Network**** - Mass transit is key.  Metro rail facilities are either being undertaken in 50 cities but they take long time to construct and expensive. A massive fleet of the electric bus that complements the rapid transit, run on the network designed and developed based on population/employment data. The first mile and last mile to be served by E-rickshaw, rideshare, bikeshare partners (Write the company name). All of the transportation can be integrated on one nation one card, recently launched by GoI on a subscription model similar to [Whim](https://whimapp.com/). A Premium on driving the automobiles will lead to less pollution and less congestion on road. Of course, energy storage and clean energy plan to be an enabler for electric transport in the country. If possible, port access should be thought of for these cities for trade and exports.
   
   1. Data about buses available by population (per thousand people) and average commute speed ease of moving
   
   2. Lane miles & number of autos avaialble 
   
   3. % mode share by country  
   
   4. Impetus to electric mode of transportation is imp and necessary 
   
   5. ***Map*** of mode share and number of people transported 
   
      
   
2. **Water, Waste Disposal, Drainage Network, Urban Forestation through geotagging**- Smart waste collection based on tracking vehicle, scheduling and using the waste to industrial usages such as road construction will help in Swach Bharat Abhiyan. Completion of no-clogs extensive drainage network to help in clean society and help in preventive care.

3. **Empower the City governing body -** Either empower the local governance, like the office of mayors to draft the city-specific growth goals or make a special purpose central body that will oversee the city affairs, draft policies and report directly to Ministry of urban development. Should be able to invite the industry captains, entrepreneurs etc. from across the world to set up the shop in the city limits and nearby area. Some of the ideas could be setting bodies like 1.) MTC  2.) Empowreing more to the local bodies 3.) Should be given special power to draw up long term development plan 3.) Hire a smart development officiers 4.) It will allow the higher FSI for the city. 5) Build-up plan to have a cluster for the city. 
   
   1. % of funds spent by local bodies, should it be changed? At least for major cities 
   
      
   
4. **City Specific University** - Effort should be made to either build a new multi disciplinary independent university supported by industrial houses (deep financianing) or massively fund one existing university in every city limit. The focus of this institution would be to treat the particular city as its laboratory for its research works, tech-incubators and new technologies. Importantly, the university should not be in a closed wall campus like the current IITs, NITs but integrated with the city such as Columbia at New York, Harvard at Boston or even BHU at Varanasi. This will foster growth on multiple levels as students will learn from the interactions with the city dwellers and work for the city specific problems in their academic/research  pursuit. Simultaneously, the city will gain from their endeavors as well in terms of start-up ecosystem, business, innovative public delivery of services. For detailed context, please see the book [India in the age of idea](https://www.amazon.in/India-Age-Ideas-Writings-2006-2018-ebook/dp/B07L31P4BH?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=_k_Cj0KCQjwivbsBRDsARIsADyISJ9w3tA0Ww0joheU5ZDncdlvtYazLvG-PQ0YWjfr_czjMhrSdGBhntQaAvBnEALw_wcB_k_&gclid=Cj0KCQjwivbsBRDsARIsADyISJ9w3tA0Ww0joheU5ZDncdlvtYazLvG-PQ0YWjfr_czjMhrSdGBhntQaAvBnEALw_wcB) by Sanjeev Sanyal. 

   

5. **Measure and mine Urban Data** - *'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it'* - This could not be truer for Indian cities. Though government has set-up a [nation wide portal](https://data.gov.in/) for Open Data yet the granularity of the same is very rudimentry. Helping government digitizing their services and periodic release of datasets akin to some world class city ([Chicago,](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) [New York](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)) is a big business opportunity. A cohort of entreprenuers could use, analyze, model and build Gov-Tech enterprise using the easily accessible open data.

   ![iudxxx](/Users/viks/Desktop/urbanization/iudxxx.jpg)In providing the services, the government should be working as an enabler rather a provider of service. Open data will help in providing better service in transportation, communicate, water, energy, waste management, business and citizen services. 

   

The impact of this will be as such - 25 years long haul kind of service** **city serves as a center to regional villages and industries**- Each of this city to serve as a regional center to a nearby village and small towns. Enabled with a large number of modern cold storages will help in agricultural produce. A large state-of-the-art hospital shall help in medical-related issues of the population nearby. Excellent port and transport rail connectivity (high-speed rail, airport, and freeway) will help in trade and uplift the population. The budding ecosystem of entrepreneurship will enable AI led start-ups (can add few pointers in AI tech as well in the manifesto) which will use the city data to provide better service to masses, spur the mega-regional growth, create huge employment opportunities and eventually make the country march towards $10tn economy.
